# personal-profile


Create your personal profile website.

If you don't want to design anything, use one of the bootstrap templates below. (Or research your own)

Your site should contain basic info about you and your contact info. (You can decide what to put- it should probably eventually contain links and content about your SEI projects- just leave some space to put those in)

See some examples in the templates below, or of past batches [here](./Meet-Greet-Main_SEI19-DMI5.pdf) and [here.](./Meet-Greet-SEI-18.pdf)

### Create a repo for github pages

This will be directly linked to your github account. Follow the instructions [here.](https://pages.github.com/)


### Buy a domain

If you want you can pay for your own domain. [Namecheap](http://namecheap.com) is a good option.

Follow the instructions for a [custom domain.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
